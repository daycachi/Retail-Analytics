# Retail-Analytics
This is an individual project that I developed while I was doing my master in Busines Analytics at Hult International Business School, the dataset was in an excel file and I read the data
with Python and used the library mlxtend and the module frequent_pattern to infer the most strongly associated product pairs (i.e. products frequently bought together) 
based on the provided shopping cart dataset. And used Tableau to show the most significant association rules.
